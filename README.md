## Results and discussions

Embroidery emerges as a prevailing trend among the works of these designers, a testament to their deep connection with Indian heritage. This rich and significant facet of the country’s cultural legacy persists and evolves, underscoring the enduring importance of this art form. Delving into the history, Indian embroidery boasts a diverse legacy spanning thousands of years. Its origins trace back to the Indus Valley Civilization (3300 BCE to 1300 BCE), and it flourished further during the Mughal period in the 16th century. The art of embroidery, a tapestry of tradition and innovation, has continued its journey through the centuries, playing a pivotal role in shaping Indian culture, particularly in the domain of fashion.

A parallel narrative unfolds with the second prominent trend — draping. This owes its prominence to the iconic saree, an integral element of Indian culture. Each state contributes its unique style to the art of saree draping. Additionally, the shawl, introduced to India by Persian settlers in the late 14th century, adds another layer of cultural richness.

A striking commonality observed across all three trends is the prominence of the color pink. The genesis of this trend can be linked to the rise of ‘Barbiecore’ with Margot Robbie’s Barbie release in June 2023. Furthermore, Valentino's introduction of a series of hot pink garments during Paris Fashion Week for fall/winter 22/23 heightened the influence of this color. The ripple effect from major fashion houses significantly impacting smaller designers manifested in Pink emerging as a dominant trend in Paris Fashion Week 2023, surpassing other fashion weeks.
Delving into the cultural significance within the Indian context, pink holds a special place as an auspicious color associated with the goddess of Wealth, Laxmi. As Juggernaut aptly notes, "before Barbiecore came Rani pink," emphasizing the enduring cultural relevance of pink as an essential component in women’s festive wear in India.

In conclusion, the exploration of prevailing trends among Indian designers on the global stage illuminates not only their profound connection with the country's rich cultural heritage but also their ability to transcend borders and captivate international audiences. The mastery of embroidery and the art of draping, deeply rooted in India's historical tapestry, showcase the designers' commitment to preserving tradition while embracing innovation.

As these designers navigate the global fashion landscape, their influence goes beyond trends; it becomes a cultural dialogue, fostering a deeper appreciation for the diversity and craftsmanship inherent in Indian fashion. The incorporation of iconic elements like the saree and the infusion of Persian-inspired drapery exemplify the designers' artistry in blending cultural narratives seamlessly.
Moreover, the choice of the color pink as a common thread across their works underscores the designers' nuanced understanding of both global fashion currents and the profound cultural symbolism that resonates within India. This harmonious interplay between tradition and contemporary influences positions Indian designers as cultural ambassadors on the world stage.
In an era where the fashion industry is increasingly recognizing and celebrating diversity, Indian designers shine as beacons of creativity and heritage. Their contributions not only elevate the global fashion conversation but also serve as a testament to the enduring allure of India's cultural tapestry, leaving an indelible mark on the world of haute couture. As the global fashion stage continues to evolve, the influence of Indian designers promises to be an integral and ever-expanding chapter in the narrative of global fashion.
