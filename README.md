# Fashion Analytics: unveiling cultural influences
## Introduction:

### Background:
The global fashion landscape is an ever-evolving tapestry woven with threads of diverse cultural influences. As fashion becomes increasingly interconnected, the contributions of Indian designers to major fashion weeks play a pivotal role in shaping this vibrant fabric. The fusion of traditional Indian aesthetics with contemporary trends not only reflects the dynamism of the fashion industry but also underscores the cultural significance embedded in every design.

In recent years, the spotlight has intensified on Indian designers participating in major fashion weeks, such as those held in Paris, London, and New York. These designers bring a unique perspective, blending rich cultural heritage with cutting-edge fashion trends. Recognizing the profound impact of cultural narratives in fashion, this study endeavors to dissect the nuanced interplay between tradition and modernity within the works of Indian designers on the global stage.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this study is to delve into the textual landscape surrounding Indian designers during Paris, London, and New York Fashion Weeks. By employing advanced text analytics, we aim to unravel the extent to which cultural heritage influences their creative expressions.

This study is like unraveling a story told by Indian designers in global fashion. By spotting shared words and themes, I am contributing insights into how tradition and modern style come together in the world of international fashion.
