Embroidery emerges as a prevailing trend among the works of these designers, a testament to their deep connection with Indian heritage. This rich and significant facet of the country’s cultural legacy persists and evolves, underscoring the enduring importance of this art form.
Delving into the history, Indian embroidery boasts a diverse legacy spanning thousands of years. Its origins trace back to the Indus Valley Civilization (3300 BCE to 1300 BCE), and it flourished further during the Mughal period in the 16th century. The art of embroidery, a tapestry of tradition and innovation, has continued its journey through the centuries, playing a pivotal role in shaping Indian culture, particularly in the domain of fashion.
A parallel narrative unfolds with the second prominent trend — draping. This owes its prominence to the iconic saree, an integral element of Indian culture. Each state contributes its unique style to the art of saree draping. Additionally, the shawl, introduced to India by Persian settlers in the late 14th century, adds another layer of cultural richness.
A striking commonality observed across all three trends is the prominence of the color pink. The genesis of this trend can be linked to the rise of ‘Barbiecore’ with Margot Robbie’s Barbie release in June 2023. Furthermore, Valentino's introduction of a series of hot pink garments during Paris Fashion Week for fall/winter 22/23 heightened the influence of this color. The ripple effect from major fashion houses significantly impacting smaller designers manifested in Pink emerging as a dominant trend in Paris Fashion Week 2023, surpassing other fashion weeks.
Delving into the cultural significance within the Indian context, pink holds a special place as an auspicious color associated with the goddess of Wealth, Laxmi. As Juggernaut aptly notes, "before Barbiecore came Rani pink," emphasizing the enduring cultural relevance of pink as an essential component in women’s festive wear in India.
