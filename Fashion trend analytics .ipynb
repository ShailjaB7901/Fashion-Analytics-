      "2: they seemed completely absorbed by their craft oblivious to the heat and to the chirping swarm of indian celebrities and socialites attending the show.\n",
      "3: theyre almost in a meditative state said mishra.\n",
      "4: probably they inhabit the forests the lotus ponds they have conversations with the tigers and birds theyre embroidering.\n",
      "5: who knows which parallel universe their fantasy is roaming.the embroiderers are part of mishras ethical community of craftsmen to which he dedicated the collection theyve been working together since he established his socially conscious fashion house.\n",
      "6: the work we do belongs to all of us to all the people that contributed to making this collection come to life he said.\n",
      "7: its a collective dream.\n",
      "8: thats why he called it we the people.\n",
      "9: i know it sounds something like the constitution.\n",
      "10: he joked.the embroidery in some of the dresses concealed minuscule figures of artisanssome peeking out from a diamond motif or sitting in circles to form the heart of a flower or a tiny portrait of the lady who actually worked on a dress.\n",
      "11: it was a touching way to give the makers pride of place enhancing their exceptional artistry and including them actively in the collections creation.\n",
      "12: mishra said that he was particularly proud of the fact that after years of training people coming from slums and from densely populated subfactory setups in large cities now the reverse migration has beguncraftsmen are returning to their local indian villages to build new communities of makers keeping traditional crafts alive.the collection boasted the flamboyance and intricacy of decoration mishra is known for.\n",
      "13: the silhouettes were loosely inspired by russianfrench artist erts art nouveau drawings and were kept slender and elongated.\n",
      "14: overblown volumes the designer called them gravity defying like petals huge bows or girandoles tops stemming from slim bottoms alternated with slender shapes short bustier dresses catsuits midriffbaring tops worn with loose trousers.\n",
      "15: tailored pantsuits were cut with straightforward simplicity as per mishras definition.\n",
      "16: yet there was nothing simple in the bedazzling glamour of the decorations and in the uninterrupted sequined shine covering every surface it gave off a sentiment of joyous excess and exuberance as if the passion for creation couldnt be contained.collectionlook 1look 2look 3look 4look 5look 6look 7look 8look 9load moremore from fall 2023\n",

      "19: well ive been working in fashion since i was 15.\n",
      "20: so i guess its a 25yearold dream in the making.\n",
      "21: when i was a student at central saint martins about 20 years back and even i used to work with hussein chalayan backstage and attend different shows i just knew i had to be here.cc your collection is inspired by the number zero shunya.\n",
      "22: how did this concept come aboutgg whenever its an extreme situation i remember when i was doing my graduate collections at saint martins i felt like i had done everything.\n",
      "23: id played with perspective pictograms and more while i was a student there.\n",
      "24: but when its a main moment for me somehow from somewhere india comes to mind.\n",
      "25: i dont usually feel very indian because my mind is very abstract and i have a very couture conceptual mind.\n",
      "26: so for right now i wanted something very subliminal and very conceptually indian which is zero.\n",
      "27: shunya was invented in india.\n",
      "28: there were no concepts of negative or positive before that  even in arithmetic and numerology it was just numbers.\n",
      "29: the understanding of not just numbers but time also was very linear.\n",
      "30: the discovery of zero made everything infinite  it made time at different tangents and made everything circular.\n",
      "31: and everything became endless on both sides.\n",
      "32: for me conceptually that has been the most inspiring thing.\n",
      "33: i wanted to look at the concept of stillness versus movement zero versus infinity.\n",
      "34: so that is the storyboard for this collection.\n",
      "35: i dont like giving myself visual references its all very philosophical almost spiritual.\n",
      "36: i let that thought dwell inside me and take a deep dive.ankitmost popularculture  livingthe best time to eat breakfast according to a nutritional expertby hasina jeelanibeautyi paused my keratin hair treatment for the first time in 12 yearsand my dry strands are thanking me for itby hasina jeelanifashionparineeti chopra in her handembroidered blush pink kurta set is a great tradein for heavily embellished kurtasby vogue.incc how many looks does the collection have what are some of the key silhouettesgg there are 35 looks in the collection and we have endless shapes in our sculpting.\n",
      "37: for the first show in paris i very much wanted the dna of the brand which is the sculpting and the endlessness and a parallel fantasy world which is infinite.\n",
      "38: i would not want any limits to imagination there.\n",
      "39: you can wear this shape it doesnt have to be patternmade.\n",
      "40: it could be structured draping gravity defying sculpting  so its all there.\n",
      "41: we started with puristic handloom tissues from india which weve sculpted just like actual sculptures.\n",
      "42: these looks start the show.\n",
      "43: the winglike sculptures are swishes around the body and you cant see a starting or an ending point to the garment  thats why theyre infinite in their shape and they appear to be moving constantly.\n",
      "44: and then we go into these indigoelectric blues which to me represent the futuristic colour of time  theres this electricity to it.\n",
      "45: the first few looks are beige golds and beigesilvers shades of sand going into this futuristic droppop\n",
      "46: and then we go into extremely elemental embroidery.\n",
      "47: theyre embroideries that look like erosion inspired by volcanic lava or even feel like ripples in the middle of the sea or abstract clouds through movement or even meteors in the sky.\n",
      "48: its almost like movements that happen in nature have been abstractly captured in those elemental dresses which are very naked.\n",

      "56: thats a word i learnt from vogue india itself.\n",
      "57: there are some hybrids.\n",
      "58: for me its not obvious but india is everywhere in subliminal ways and the maximalism in my art and couture is very indian as well.\n",

      "49: its completely insensitive.\n",
      "50: its almost as if people dont understand the traumas immigrants go through.\n",
      "51: and even if you look at the vocabulary around it  when people from the west move to countries in the socalled developing world they call themselves expats.\n",
      "52: the word immigrant becomes reserved for people of colour who move to predominantly white countries which i find really interesting because i have yet to find the difference between the two.its a subject that disturbs and distracts him.\n",

      "54: i emigrated here to build a life and i dont see myself as different from other people.\n",

      "56: when brexit happened it was so sad because theres a whole generation of young people now who will be deprived of so many experiences its such a shame isnt it when you think about food and fashion and just falling in love its such a shame.\n",
      "57: why would you not want that this government he adds instead of trying to fix real problems  energy prices the environment trading with europe which from recent personal experience i can say continues to be an absolute clusterfuck is trying to deflect by blaming refugees.\n",
      "58: it would be laughable if it wasnt so cruel and tragic.\n",
      "59: privileged people who have such a lack of humanity and empathy should not be in these positions of power.when he wore the tshirt i felt like i was coming out as an immigrant gupta chuckles.\n",
      "60: but the subject creeps into his work in less obvious ways too.\n",
      "61: growing up in delhi homosexuality was illegal and he dreamed of moving to new york or paris or london a world of escapism and fabulousness.\n",
      "62: sequins remind me of that of big cities at night.\n",
      "63: because cities have always been such a refuge for people or communities who have felt not the norm.\n",
      "64: for gay men moving from small towns a citys nightlife becomes a kind of refuge.\n",
      "65: using sequins reminds me of that idea of not being hidden.glamour and glitz ashish springsummer 2016the clothes gupta designs use sequins to disrupt and deceive the eye with trompe loeil effects and unexpected references.\n",
      "66: the draw of the sparkle feels primal  that ancient search for water  but in his 20 years working with sequins making his own fabrics handembroidering them theyre the opposite of fast or throwaway fashion  a typical dress costs about 2000 working out how best to help them catch the light gupta has had time to go deeper.\n",
      "67: part of my attraction to sequins is that collision of high and low taste.\n",
      "68: when i started designing they really had this dodgy cocktail dress kind of association.\n",
      "69: i love a bit of bad taste so that was part of it.\n",
      "70: he strokes his beard as he thinks.\n",
      "71: the other thing is this idea of glamour.\n",
      "72: the word comes from the idea of witches casting a spell.\n",
      "73: so its a very powerful association.\n",
      "74: and i think about the golden age of hollywood and how sequins look on film.\n",
      "75: theres such a magical quality about them.\n",
      "76: plus the danger and beauty i associate with nightlife  you want to be seen but theres a mystery there.\n",

      "82: they feel like i dont want to say sacred\n",
      "83: but i suppose i like to be on the outside looking in.\n",
      "84: he looks a little sheepish.pulling old work out for the retrospective gupta was pleasantly surprised to find it was fabulous like the earliest piece from 2003 its like the campest rugby shirt in the world in gold and silver stripes which came from the idea of taking something hyper masculine fetishising and subverting it.\n",
      "85: and the bags where he reimagined supermarket plastic bags in sequins  instead of tesco the letters spelled disco.\n",
      "86: instead of ms sm.\n",
      "87: they had a gentle humour about them.\n",
      "88: but also it was that idea of taking something disposable from everyday life and making it really special elevating it.\n",
      "89: he shrugs.\n",
      "90: its a really nice thing to be able to create joy.\n",
      "91: im grateful for that.in the past gupta has booked holidays  flights hotels packed a suitcase but found himself unable to leave for the airport.\n",
      "92: i dont think ive had longer than four days off in a row in the past 20 years he winces.\n",

      "96: oh yes he has so many stories he says.\n",
      "97: and its a subject hes close to because often we dress up to get undressed.\n",
      "98: so when i design a dress ill think about how easy it is to get off  i always put zips.\n",
      "99: and i love pockets.\n",
      "100: i once lent a trenchcoat to redacted alist celebrity and when i got it back there was a pair of knickers in the pocket.\n",
      "101: i thought well shes had a great time the ultimate compliment.when he says trenchcoat of course its important to realise what he means is something more like a sculpture in the shape of a trenchcoat but made painstakingly by hand of discos and cotton.\n",
      "102: when we talk about politics about that doomful year of brexit and trump he remembers being at a rally and seeing a gold sparkling sign that said fighting gloom with glitter i was very inspired by that he says.\n",

      "11: even then no one noticed it for two weeks until it was on twitter which is where it kind of got noticed.\n",
      "12: sv you say you accidentally got into the london college of fashion.\n",
      "13: how does that happen to anyone harri i am from kerala and i lived there till i was 18.\n",
      "14: then i moved to bengaluru and got into the national institute of fashion technology nift to pursue fashion design.\n",

      "19: my friend and i wanted to do it together.\n",
      "20: i was just there to support her interview but we both got in.\n",
      "21: sv does the love and virality thats come your way so nonchalantly from a collection that was meant to be part of your graduation curriculum put a lot of pressure on you to create  harri there are so many layers to this.\n",
      "22: yes you created something and are getting a lot of attention for it.\n",
      "23: people are commenting on your work and you are getting various perspectives.\n",
      "24: normally if you are in college you get reviews from your tutors or judges and when you present your collection as an established designer you get reviews from the press.\n",
      "25: i though am being judged by everyone even by people on the street.\n",
      "26: youre kind of put in a place where you have to justify what you do to people who you were not taught to justify to and of course to your parents.\n",
      "27: sv it is often challenging for indian parents to understand careers and concepts like your latex trousers.\n",
      "28: do yours understand it what was their reaction to it harri when i told my father i was preparing for my showroom presentation in paris he asked me are you still making rubber clothes the implied question there was whether or not i had progressed to making actual clothes yet.\n",
      "29: so you know what im dealing with.\n",
      "30: and thats the thing now i have to explain myself to everyone and that kind of puts me under pressure.\n",
      "31: in addition to this one also needs to deal with all the negative comments on social mediathere were a lot of negative comments on youtube after this highly experimental graduate collection was launched.\n",
      "32: sv do you have a reddit thread yet harri i do.\n",
      "33: i have a reddit thread and i have a youtube comments section.\n",
      "34: but after a point you kind of feel good because you see all these people talking about your work.\n",
      "35: now its all about sustaining the work and evolving.\n",
      "36: its about finding how i can do more how i can move forward.\n",
      "37: sv where has that stream of thought led you to you said you dont want people to talk about the trousers\n",
      "38: anymore\n",
      "39: so what do you want them to talk about harri do i have any control over people talking about anything if i think in that direction then there is the pressure to create things that people question or become conversation starters.\n",
      "40: i dont want to create anything with virality or talk about it as a byproduct.\n",
      "41: i just enjoy the process of creating a piece.\n",
      "42: my pure pleasure while designing the pants was finding ways to fill in the air creating all the structures and thinking of ways in which i can make it wearable.\n",
      "43: thats the final challenge i can create the shape i can even sculpt it but what happens after it is out of my studio how will it be more wearable for me its not what people will talk about.\n",
      "44: yes it helps me when people talk about it i can write my references bring out my references or make it more relatable.\n",
      "45: but really its just about the pleasure of making.\n",
      "46: sv now that its been so many months to the moment how has the buyers reaction been to all of this the trousers come with a lot of instructionsdont overinflate keep them away from heat metals oils and more.\n",
      "47: harri the buyers are extremely aware of what theyre buying.\n",
      "48: its a highvalue product because everything is handmade.\n",
      "49: it is a specialised customised piece.\n",
      "50: i have that time and liberty to educate the customer on the piecehow to use it how to keep it and how to maintain it.\n",
      "51: i am not producing it in bulk although last season some buyers did ask for more pieces.\n",
      "52: sv would you say its costume too  harri\n",
      "53: yes\n",
      "54: but it depends on the customer and how they want to interpret it you can wear it for an event at the club or a performance there are a lot of occasions when you can wear it.\n",
      "55: sv so wearability versus costuming do you prefer either or do you think the right garment should have a mixture of both  harri as a designer i dont think its eitheror you can do both.\n",
      "56: its the result of a collection with so many garments and artefacts.\n",
      "57: it is called a collection because there are so many things to it.\n",
      "58: im very happy that my collection has so many things to offer to so many types of peopletheres a performance audience a readytowear audience a statement audience.\n",
      "59: sv do you have an ideal audience who you want to cater to harri\n",
      "60: oh thats a tough question.\n",
      "61: if i knew that id be in a better place right\n",
      "62: but for something like the inflatable trousers i would say the ideal audience is very risktaking people from different walks of life.\n",
      "63: ive had a second season of readytowear which is more safe and more accessible its toned down.\n",
      "64: sv your use of channapatna beads in the debut collection didnt make it to the news as much but it gave such a great glimpse of your heritage.\n",
      "65: harri i cant think without going back to my indian roots it is part of everything i do.\n",
      "66: i come to india all the time to source and work.\n",
      "67: for example my dyers are in india i have a dyer who has been in the trade for almost 40 years and has been working with me for six years.\n",
      "68: sv where do you procure most of your material from in india and how often does your work bring you back to the country  harri i procure material from channapatna delhi and ludhiana and my assistant is based in kerala.\n",
      "69: but i dont visit india frequently\n",
      "70: i come once every six months for a month and spend half my time in delhi and the other half in kerala.\n",
      "71: i cant spend too much time in india because a lot of my operations and my pr are in the uk.\n",
      "72: eventually i want to spend equal time in india and the uk travelling every three months but i dont think thats possible at this point.\n",
      "73: sv are there any other techniques textures or fabrics that you are currently experimenting with for your next collection  harri yes.\n",
      "74: we are developing a handwoven fabric in india.\n",
      "75: i have a group of knitters in new delhi working with us this season.\n",
      "76: i dont have a clear idea what these would be because they are still getting made.\n",
      "77: sv did you ever end up wearing the pants harri no.\n",
      "78: i dont think im going to wear it.\n",
      "79: im just going to keep it.\n",
      "80: its like my mother cooking beef she never had it\n",
      "81: but she cooks amazing beef.\n",
      "82: sv whats next for you harri setting up a sustainable business model and at the same time developing my artistic identity.\n",
      "83: london is a good place to balance both.\n",
      "84: it has a history of both.\n",
      "85: so im in the right place.\n",
      "86: i just need to make sure i spend the next couple of seasons refining my core offerings figuring out my core competence evaluating what resources i have and what resources i need.\n",
      "87: and then its just about bringing it all together and seeing how i can move forward with it.                   view this post on instagram                                  a post shared by h a r r i    harriks      sv do any other indian designers inspire you harri\n",
      "88: i was in fashion because i liked tailoring and i liked making things.\n",
      "89: when i was in india i didnt care much about fashion and i didnt care about designers so much that was never my world.\n",
      "90: this was until 2018.\n",
      "91: i started caring about these things after my collection went viral.\n",
      "92: i thought now that people call me a fashion designer let me check who else is a designer.\n",
      "93: who the indian designers are who the international designers are who the gods of fashion are before that i just wanted to create and i had the pleasure of creating.\n",
      "94: that said i have worked with suket dhir\n",
